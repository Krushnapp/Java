## Memory Breakdown for the Java Code

  class lol { 
        void grin(int c){
          int a=c;

          System.out.println(a);

      }

    static  void prin(int c){
          int a=c;
           int b =7;
          System.out.println(b);

      }
    // Main driver method 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
    lol a = new lol();
          a.prin(8);
    } 
  }
Let's analyze the provided Java code and explain what goes into each memory region:

**MetaSpace:**

* Class `lol` definition (bytecodes, field/method signatures)
* Information about primitive data types (`int`) used in the class

**Heap:**

* Object of class `lol` created in `main` method (`a`)

**Stack:**

* When `main` method is called:
    * A stack frame is created containing information about the method call, including:
        * Local variable `args` (reference to the String array passed as arguments)
    * When `a.prin(8)` is called:
        * A new stack frame is created for the `prin` method call, containing:
            * Local variable `c` (stores the value 8)
            * Local variable `a` (reference to the object `lol` created in `main`)
        * Inside `prin`:
            * Local variable `a` (stores the reference to the object `lol`)
            * Local variable `b` (stores the value 7)

**Explanation:**

1. **MetaSpace:** When the program starts, the JVM loads the class definition for `lol`. This includes the bytecode instructions, field and method signatures, and information about primitive data types like `int`. This metadata is stored in MetaSpace, a non-heap memory area.
2. **Heap:** In the `main` method, an object of class `lol` is created using `new lol()`. This object is allocated memory from the heap. The object itself stores references to its methods and any instance variables it might have (there are none in this example).
3. **Stack:** When the `main` method is called, a stack frame is created on the stack. This frame holds information about the method call, like local variables. When `a.prin(8)` is called, another stack frame is created specifically for the `prin` method. This new frame holds local variables for `c` (stores the argument 8) and `a` (a reference to the `lol` object). Inside the `prin` method, additional local variables `a` (reference) and `b` (value 7) are stored on the stack frame.

**Important Points:**

* The stack is used for method calls and local variables. It's a fixed-size memory area and grows/shrinks with each method call/return.
* The heap is used for object allocation and grows dynamically as needed.
* Once the `main` method and `prin` method finish executing, their respective stack frames are removed, freeing up memory on the stack.
* The object `lol` remains in the heap until it becomes unreachable and is garbage collected.

**Note:** This code example is very simple. In more complex programs, the stack and heap would be used more extensively to store program data and manage object references.
