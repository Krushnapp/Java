Here are 10 essential Java classes you should know for your interview, covering core functionalities and object-oriented principles:

1. String: The fundamental class for representing text data. Understand methods like `charAt()`, `substring()`, `equals()`, `compareTo()`, and immutability of Strings.

2. StringBuilder: A mutable string builder for efficient string manipulation. Useful for frequent string concatenation scenarios.  Know methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `reverse()`.

3. Object: The root class of all objects in Java. Understand its methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. Be familiar with concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

4. System: Provides access to system functionalities like standard input/output (`System.in`, `System.out`), system properties (`System.getProperty()`), and exit (`System.exit()`).

5. ArrayList: A resizable array-based implementation of the List interface. Efficient for random access but slower for insertions/deletions in the middle. Understand methods like `add()`, `get()`, `remove()`, and `size()`.

6. HashMap: An implementation of the Map interface that stores key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and have a valid `hashCode()` method. Familiarize yourself with `put()`, `get()`, `containsKey()`, and `hashCode()` concepts.

7. Scanner: A class for reading input from the user. Useful for taking user input in console applications. Understand `nextLine()`, `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, etc. for different data types.

8. Math: Provides a collection of mathematical functions like `sin()`, `cos()`, `sqrt()`, `abs()`, `max()`, `min()`. Be aware of potential rounding errors with floating-point numbers.

9. Exception: The base class for all exceptions in Java. Understand how exceptions are used for error handling and `try-catch` blocks. Explore common exceptions like `NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

10. Arrays: Represents a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Understand array creation, accessing elements (`array[index]`), iterating with loops, and common methods like `length`, `copyOf()`.

While this list covers core functionalities, consider tailoring your knowledge to the specific role you're interviewing for. Some interviews might focus more on advanced topics like concurrency (`Thread`, `ExecutorService`) or collections framework utilities (`Collections`).

Remember, understanding the usage and purpose of these classes is key. Be prepared to discuss trade-offs between different implementations (e.g., ArrayList vs. LinkedList) and demonstrate your ability to apply them in coding scenarios.
