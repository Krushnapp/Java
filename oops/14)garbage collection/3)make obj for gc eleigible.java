Sure! Here's an example of each of the ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection in Java:

Nullifying references:
java
Copy code
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
// Use obj...
obj = null; // obj no longer refers to the object, so it becomes eligible for garbage collection
Scoping:
javascript
Copy code
void myMethod() {
  MyObject obj = new MyObject();
  // Use obj...
} // obj goes out of scope and becomes eligible for garbage collection
Reassignment:
scss
Copy code
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
// Use obj...
obj = new MyObject(); // obj now refers to a different object, so the previous object becomes eligible for garbage collection
Explicit deallocation:
java
Copy code
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
// Use obj...
obj = null; // obj no longer refers to the object, but garbage collection is handled automatically in Java, so explicit deallocation is not necessary
