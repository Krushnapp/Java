I'll provide a comprehensive response to your inquiries about Garbage Collection (GC) in Java:

**What is Garbage Collection?**

Garbage collection (GC) is an automated process in Java that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. It identifies and reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable by your program, preventing memory leaks and optimizing memory usage.

**Garbage Collection Cycle:**

1. **Object Creation:** When you create a new object using the `new` keyword, memory is allocated for the object in the heap.
2. **Object Usage:** The object is used in your program, with references pointing to it from variables or other objects.
3. **Object Becomes Unreachable:** Over time, objects might become unreachable because:
   - Local variables containing references go out of scope (method execution finishes).
   - Instance variables holding references are overwritten with references to other objects.
   - No other references remain anywhere in the program.
4. **Garbage Collection:** The GC cycle kicks in, identifying unreachable objects using algorithms like mark-and-sweep or copying.
5. **Memory Reclamation:** Unreachable objects are removed from the heap, freeing up memory for future object allocations.

**Why GC is Considered Expensive:**

While GC automates memory management, it's not entirely free from overhead:

- **CPU Usage:** The GC process itself consumes CPU resources for identifying and reclaiming objects. This can lead to temporary slowdowns during GC cycles.
- **Pauses:** Some GC algorithms (like stop-the-world) can temporarily pause application execution while identifying unreachable objects.

**Performance Improvement After GC:**

- **Freed Memory:** By reclaiming memory from unused objects, GC ensures that more memory is available for future object allocations. This prevents memory exhaustion and potential `OutOfMemoryError`.
- **Reduced Memory Pressure:** Less memory pressure allows the JVM to optimize other aspects of program execution, potentially leading to smoother performance after a GC cycle.

**Preventing OutOfMemoryError:**

Without GC, manually managing memory allocation and deallocation can be error-prone and lead to memory leaks, where unused objects accumulate and eventually exhaust available memory, resulting in `OutOfMemoryError`. GC automates this process, preventing such leaks.

**Garbage Collection Thread:**

- A dedicated low-priority **daemon thread** is responsible for running the GC cycles. This ensures that GC happens automatically without needing explicit user intervention but does not interfere with the execution of your application's main threads.

**Memory Fragmentation:**

- Over time, as objects are created and reclaimed, the heap might become fragmented. This means the available memory is divided into non-contiguous chunks, potentially making it harder to allocate large objects in a single block.
- Some GC algorithms (like copying) can help mitigate fragmentation by copying surviving objects into a contiguous space.

**Application Slowdown During GC:**

- While the GC daemon thread has a lower priority, it can still cause temporary slowdowns during GC cycles, especially when dealing with large heaps or frequent object creation/destruction.
- The extent of the slowdown depends on various factors, including the GC algorithm used, the amount of memory being reclaimed, and the application's overall workload.

**Explicitly Requesting GC:**

- In Java, you cannot directly initiate a GC cycle using a standard method call.
- However, you can hint to the GC that it might be a good time to run a cycle using `System.gc()`. This is just a suggestion, and the JVM might not necessarily act upon it immediately.

**`System.gc()` and GC:**

- `System.gc()` is not guaranteed to trigger a GC cycle. The JVM might choose to ignore it based on its internal state and memory management strategies.
- It's generally not recommended to rely on `System.gc()` for performance optimization, as it can introduce unnecessary overhead and unpredictability.

**Summary:**

Garbage collection is a crucial mechanism in Java that automates memory management, preventing memory leaks and optimizing memory usage. While it might introduce some overhead, the benefits of preventing `OutOfMemoryError` and ensuring long-term application stability outweigh the drawbacks. Understanding these concepts allows you to write memory-efficient Java code and avoid potential memory-related issues.
