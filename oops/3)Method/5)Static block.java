Static blocks, also known as static initializers, are a feature of the Java programming language that allow developers to execute code when a class is loaded into memory.

Static blocks are enclosed in braces {} and are marked with the static keyword. They are executed only once when the class is loaded, usually before any other methods or constructors in the class are executed.

Here's an example of a static block:


Copy code
public class MyClass {
  static {
    System.out.println("This is a static block!");
  }
}
In this example, the static block will be executed when the MyClass class is loaded into memory, and it will print the message "This is a static block!" to the console.

Static blocks are commonly used to initialize static variables, set up configuration parameters, or perform other one-time initialization tasks. They can also be used to catch and handle exceptions that might be thrown during initialization.

It's important to note that static blocks are executed in the order they are defined in the class, so developers should be careful to ensure that the order of initialization is correct. Additionally, because static blocks are executed only once, they should not be used for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly or dynamically during runtime.
