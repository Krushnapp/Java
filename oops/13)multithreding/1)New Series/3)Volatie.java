While the `volatile` keyword isn't necessary for thread safety within the `useThread` method itself (due to its asynchronous execution within a single thread), it can be relevant for ensuring visibility of changes made by `useThread` to other parts of your application.

Here's a scenario where you might consider using `volatile` in this context:

- Shared State Monitoring:
    - Imagine a scenario where you have a variable `completionFlag` outside of `useThread` that's used to track its completion status.
    - Multiple parts of your application might need to access this flag to determine if `useThread` has finished its task.

Using `volatile` to Ensure Visibility:

```java
public class Main {

    private volatile boolean completionFlag = false; // Make completionFlag volatile

    @Async
    public void useThread(int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(k + 1);
        }
        completionFlag = true; // Set completionFlag after completion
    }

    // Other methods that might access completionFlag
}
```

How It Works:

- By declaring `completionFlag` as `volatile`, you guarantee that any changes made to it within `useThread` (in this case, setting it to `true`) will be immediately visible to other threads in your application.
- This ensures that even if `useThread` runs on a different thread, other parts of your application will always see the latest value of `completionFlag`, avoiding inconsistencies and potential race conditions.

Key Points:

- `volatile` doesn't replace proper synchronization mechanisms for more complex shared data access.
- It's primarily used for visibility guarantees, not mutual exclusion or atomic operations.

When to Use `volatile` Cautiously:

- If multiple threads need to modify a shared variable concurrently, use synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks or locks instead of just `volatile`.
- Avoid unnecessary `volatile` usage as it can slightly impact performance due to additional memory barriers.
