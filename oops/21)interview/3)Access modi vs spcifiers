In Java, access specifiers and access modifiers are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, but they actually refer to different things.

Access Specifiers:
Access specifiers determine the visibility and accessibility of a class, method, or variable in the context of the program. There are four access specifiers in Java:

Public: A public class, method, or variable can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

Private: A private class, method, or variable can only be accessed within the same class where it is defined.

Protected: A protected class, method, or variable can be accessed within the same package as well as by its subclasses.

Default or package-private: A class, method, or variable with no access specifier specified can only be accessed within the same package.

Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers, on the other hand, are a subset of access specifiers that modify the behavior of a class, method, or variable beyond just their visibility. There are five access modifiers in Java:

Public: As an access modifier, public allows unrestricted access to a class, method, or variable.

Private: As an access modifier, private restricts access to a class, method, or variable to only the same class where it is defined.

Protected: As an access modifier, protected allows access to a class, method, or variable within the same package as well as by its subclasses.

Default or package-private: As an access modifier, default or package-private restricts access to a class, method, or variable to only the same package.

Static: As an access modifier, static is used to create class-level variables and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
