private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();


Conceptual Breakdown of ConcurrentHashMap:

1. Hash Table: Uses a hash table to store key-value pairs.
2. Segments: The hash table is divided into segments (buckets).
3. Locking: Each segment has its own lock (often a lightweight lock like `ReentrantLock`).
4. Operations: When performing operations like `put` or `get`, the thread acquires the lock for the corresponding segment based on the key's hash value. This ensures only one thread modifies a specific segment at a time, preventing race conditions.

Code Example with Similar Functionality (Not a true ConcurrentHashMap):

While you can't replicate the exact implementation of `ConcurrentHashMap`, here's a simplified example using a regular `HashMap` and synchronization to achieve thread-safe operations:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class MyConcurrentHashMap {

    private final Map<Integer, String> map;
    private final ReentrantLock[] locks; // Array of locks for each segment

    public MyConcurrentHashMap(int initialCapacity) {
        map = new HashMap<>(initialCapacity);
        locks = new ReentrantLock[initialCapacity];
        for (int i = 0; i < initialCapacity; i++) {
            locks[i] = new ReentrantLock();
        }
    }

    public synchronized void put(Integer key, String value) {
        int segment = Math.abs(key.hashCode() % locks.length); // Calculate segment using hash
        locks[segment].lock(); // Acquire lock for the segment
        try {
            map.put(key, value);
        } finally {
            locks[segment].unlock(); // Release lock after operation
        }
    }

    public synchronized String get(Integer key) {
        int segment = Math.abs(key.hashCode() % locks.length);
        locks[segment].lock();
        try {
            return map.get(key);
        } finally {
            locks[segment].unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- This code defines a `MyConcurrentHashMap` class that mimics some functionalities of `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- It uses a regular `HashMap` to store key-value pairs.
- An array of `ReentrantLock` objects represents segment locks.
- The `put` and `get` methods are synchronized, ensuring only one thread accesses the map for a specific key at a time.
- The segment lock is acquired before modifying the map and released afterward.

Important Note:

- This is a simplified example and doesn't include all the optimizations and features of a real `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- Using a `ConcurrentHashMap` is generally recommended for thread-safe access to a map in Java due to its efficient implementation and potential performance benefits.
