  ## Running a Java Program with Student Object: A Memory Journey

  Let's walk through what happens in memory when you run a Java program that creates a `Student` object with static fields and a `save` method, considering the roles of Metaspace, Heap (with Eden, Survivor, Tenured generations), Stack, and potential garbage collection (GC) scenarios (assuming G1 collector for illustration):

  1. Program Start:

  - Metaspace: When you compile your Java code, class definitions (including `Student`) and method information (like `save`) are loaded into Metaspace. This persists throughout the program execution and doesn't participate in GC.
  - Heap: The JVM allocates memory for the heap from the available RAM.
  - Stack: A fixed-size stack is created within RAM for method calls and local variables.

  2. Creating a Student Object:

  - Heap (Eden Space): When you create a new `Student` object using `new Student()`, memory is allocated for the object in Eden space within the Young Generation of the heap. This space holds newly created objects.
  - Stack: A reference variable (e.g., `student`) pointing to the newly created `Student` object is created on the stack. This variable stores the memory address of the object in Eden space.

  3. Static Fields:

  - Memory for static fields of the `Student` class (if any) might be allocated in a dedicated area within the heap (not necessarily Eden space). Static fields are shared among all instances of the class and typically initialized during class loading.

  4. save() Method:

  - When you call the `save()` method on the `student` object:
      - The method signature and bytecode are located in Metaspace.
      - A new method call frame is pushed onto the stack, containing arguments (if any) and references to local variables used within the method.
      - The code in the `save()` method executes, potentially accessing the object's fields and performing operations.

  5. Garbage Collection (GC):

  - G1 collector continuously monitors the heap's memory usage. If Eden space fills up, a Minor GC cycle might be triggered:
      - Unreachable objects (objects without any references pointing to them) in Eden space are identified and reclaimed.
      - Surviving objects (including the `student` object as long as `student` still refers to it) might be copied to one of the Survivor spaces based on the G1 collector's algorithm.

  6. Object Lifetime:

  - If the `student` object is no longer needed and there are no other references to it (e.g., the variable `student` goes out of scope), it becomes unreachable.
  - During a subsequent Minor GC cycle, the unreachable `student` object in a Survivor space would be reclaimed, freeing up memory in the Young Generation.

  7. Tenured Generation:

  - If the `Student` object survives multiple Minor GC cycles and reaches the "tenuring threshold" configured for the G1 collector, it might be promoted to the Tenured Generation in the heap. This generation is for long-lived objects and experiences less frequent but more time-consuming Major GC cycles.

  Summary:

  - The `Student` object resides in the heap (Eden space initially).
  - References to the object are stored on the stack.
  - Metaspace stores class definitions and method information.
  - G1 collector manages memory in the heap, reclaiming unreachable objects during GC cycles.

  This is a simplified explanation. G1 collector's behavior can be more complex depending on memory usage patterns and collector configuration. However, it provides a general understanding of how memory is allocated and managed when running a Java program with object creation, method calls, and potential GC activity.
