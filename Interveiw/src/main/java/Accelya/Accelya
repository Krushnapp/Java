## **6. Real-World Scenarios**

26. How did you ensure zero downtime during migration from RabbitMQ to Kafka?
27. How did you migrate historical data from RabbitMQ to Kafka?
28. How did you handle message format compatibility (Avro/JSON/Protobuf)?
29. What monitoring tools did you use for Kafka consumers and producers?
30. What best practices did you follow to ensure secure inter-service communication?

⚡ Tip: You don’t need to **master everything**, but for each question:

* Have a **2–3 line confident answer** (with a keyword like partition, offset, JWT, TLS handshake).
* Be ready with **1–2 real examples** (like “In our migration, we faced offset mismatch issue and solved it by resetting offsets via Kafka CLI”).

👉 Do you want me to now **prepare the short model answers** (2–3 lines each) for these 30 questions so you can memorize and practice?
